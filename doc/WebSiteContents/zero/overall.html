<p><strong>Module Zero </strong>implements fundamental concepts of ASP.NET 
Boilerplate framework such as tenant management (multi-tenancy), role 
management, user management, authorization (permission system), setting 
management and audit logging.</p>
<h3>Microsoft ASP.NET Identity Framework</h3>
<p>Module Zero is based on Microsoft's
<a href="http://www.asp.net/identity" target="_blank">ASP.NET Identity Framework</a>. 
It implements user and role stores using generic repositories and extends user 
and role managers. Supports any ORM that can be used with ASP.NET Boilerplate 
(like Entity Framework and NHibernate).</p>
<p>While module zero extends Identity Framework, it has many unique features as 
described below.</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>In ASP.NET Boilerplate system, users are authorized by permissions. A <strong>
permission </strong>is a specific privilege for a certain functionality of the 
application. It can be "entering a specific page", or "performing some specific 
action in a page" or a more general access right (like downloading excel files 
in the application). See <span class="auto-style1">authorization documentation</span> 
for more information.</p>
<h3>Role Management</h3>
<p>Roles are used to <strong>group permissions</strong>. When a user has a role, 
then he/she will have all permissions of that role. In module-zero, roles can be 
dynamic or static:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Static role</strong>: A static role has a known <strong>name
	</strong>(like 'admin') and can not change this name (we can change <strong>
	display name</strong>). It's exists on the system startup and can not be 
	deleted. Thus, we can write code based on a static role name.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic (non static) role</strong>: We can create a dynamic role 
	after deployment. Then we can grant permissions for that role, we can assign 
	the role to some users and we can delete it. We can not know names of 
	dynamic roles in development time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Default role(s)</h4>
<p>One or more roles can be set as <strong>default</strong>. Default roles are 
assigned to new added/registered users as default. This is not a development 
time property and can be set or changed after deployment.</p>
<h3>User Management</h3>
<p>Users are people who can <strong>login </strong>to the application and 
perform some operations based on their <strong>permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>A user can have zero or more <strong>roles</strong>. A user inherits union of 
permissions of his all roles. Also, we can set <strong>user-specific permission</strong>. 
A user specific permission setting overrides role settings for this permission.</p>
<h3>Multi Tenancy</h3>
<p>Multitenancy refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of 
a software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
</p>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate <strong>supports</strong>, module-zero <strong>implements
</strong>multi-tenancy. Thus, we can have an application <strong>deployed
</strong>into one environment but used by <strong>multiple customers </strong>
(tenants) simultaneously. </p>
<p>A tenant can have it's own <strong>roles</strong>, <strong>users </strong>and
<strong>settings</strong>. </p>
<p>It's not limited to roles, users and settings. We can implement <strong>
IMustHaveTenant</strong> and <strong>IMayHaveTenant</strong> for entities which 
should be tenant-specific. ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically hides (filters) 
other tenant entities when logged in with a tenant's user. See
<span class="auto-style1">data filters</span> documentation.</p>
<h3>Setting Management</h3>
<p>Module zero implements setting store of ASP.NET Boilerplate to store/retrieve 
settings to/from database. See <span class="auto-style1">setting documentation</span> 
for more information.</p>
<h3>Audit Logging</h3>
<p>Module zero implements ASP.NET Boilerplate's <span class="auto-style1">audit 
logging</span> system. Thus, automatically logs every action to the database.</p>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>Module zero implements<strong> IAbpSession</strong>. You can inject it 
anywhere to get current user and tenant ids. Also, <strong>IPermissionChecker</strong> 
can be used to check a user for a permssion.</p>
