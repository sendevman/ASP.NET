<h3 id="DocIntroLayers">Introduction</h3>
<p>Layering of an application's code-base is widely accepted technique to reduce 
complexity and improve re-usability. There are many implementations of layering consist 
of diffrent count of layers. In <strong>domain driven design</strong>, there are 
four fundamental 
layers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: Provides interface to the user. 
	Uses application layer to achive user interactions.</li>
	<li><strong>Application Layer</strong>: Mediates between presentation layer 
	and domain layer. Orchestrates business objects to perform specific 
	application tasks.</li>
	<li><strong>Domain Layer</strong>: Includes business objects and rules. It's 
	the heart of the application.</li>
	<li><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong>: Provides generic technical capabilities that support the higher layers. 
	Implementing repositories to interact with database using an ORM framework is 
	an example of responsibilities of infrastructure layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be some additional layers if application needs. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Distributed service layer</strong>: Used to expose application 
	features to remote clients. There are some tools for that, like ASP.NET Web 
	API and WCF.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are common layers of a domain-centric architecture. There may be minor 
differences in implementations.</p>

<p>Here, a solution with five projects for a simple application with layers:</p>
<p>
<img alt="A solution structure" height="121" src="/SiteFiles/Content/Documents/Resources/StsSolutionStructure.png" width="292" /></p>
<p>A layer can be implemented as one or more assembly. Especially, it may be 
good to create more than one assembly for third-part dependencies (like 
NHibernate here).</p>
<h4 id="DocDomainLayer">Domain (core) layer</h4>
<p>This is the layer where all business rules should be implemented.
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">Entities</a> represents data and operations 
of business domain. Generally they are mapped to database tables in practice.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">Repositories</a> have collection-like 
interfaces and are used to retrive entities from a data source (database) and 
reflect changes to the database. Domain layer defined repositories but does not 
implement it. They are implemented in infrastructure layer.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/EventBus-Domain-Events">Domain events</a> can be 
used here to define domain specific events, trigger and handle them. Domain 
services works with entities and implements business rules those do not fit in a 
single entity. There may be also other business classes here.</p>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">Unit of work</a> pattern is used to 
manage database connection and transaction in an application operation and 
automatically save changes to database at the end of the operation.</p>
<p>This layer should be independent of third-party libraries as 
much as possible.</p>
<h4 id="DocAppLayer">Application layer</h4>
<p>Application layer contains <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">
application services</a> those are used by presentation layer. An application 
service method gets a <a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects">DTO</a> 
(Data Transfer Object) as input, uses this input to perform some specific domain 
layer operation and returns a DTO if needed. It does not get/return entities 
ideally. Thus, presentation layer is abstracted from domain layer. An 
application service method generally considered as a
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work#DocAppServices">unit of work</a>. Also,
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects">validating user 
inputs</a> is implemented in this layer. ASP.NET Boilerplate provides 
infrastructure to implement validation easily. It's suggested to use a tool for 
mapping entities to DTOs such as <a href="http://automapper.org" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a> library.</p>
<h4 id="DocInfraLayer">Infrastructure layer</h4>
<p>Domain layer just defines interface for
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">repositories</a>, infrastructure layer 
implements repositories using ORM tools like 
<a href="/Pages/Documents/NHibernate-Integration" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> or 
<a href="/Pages/Documents/EntityFramework-Integration" target="_blank">EntityFramework</a>. 
ASP.NET Boilerplate directly provides base classes to work these frameworks. Infrastructure layer is used to abstract dependencies to third-party libraries 
from other layes.
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768664/Introduction-to-ASP-NET-Boilerplate#InfraMigrations" target="_blank">
Database migrations</a> can be used here.</p>
<h4 id="DocPresentationLayer">Web &amp; presentation layers</h4>
<p>Web layer is implemented using ASP.NET MVC and Web API. Two 
approaches can be implemented here: Single-Page Applications or Multi-Page 
Applications.</p>
<p>In a <strong>Single-Page web application</strong>, all resources are loaded once 
(or a core resource is loaded and others are lazy loaded when needed) to the 
client (browser), then all interaction to the server is made using AJAX calls, 
HTML code is generated in the client with the data received from server. Never 
refreshes the whole page. There are also SPA frameworks like 
<a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJs</a>, 
<a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">DurandalJs</a>, 
<a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">BackboneJs</a>,
<a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">EmberJs</a>... and so on. ASP.NET 
Boilerplate can work with any of them. But provides samples and some helper 
mechanisms to easily work with AngularJs and DurandalJs.</p>
<p>In a <strong>Multi-Page (classic) web applications</strong>, client requests 
to the server, the server side code (ASP.NET MVC Controllers) gets data from 
database, (Razor views) generates HTML and sends back to the client.</p>
<p>A SPA and MPA are completety different architectures. In an admin 
panel (entered via password) is a perfect candidate for a SPA. On the 
other hand, a blog fits to a MPA since it should be investigated by search 
engines. Even there are some tools those help you to make SPAs visible by search 
engines, general approach is like that for now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr" target="_blank">SignalR</a> is a perfect 
tool to send push-notifications from server to the client. It can be used to 
provide real-time experience to the user. There are many javascript libraries &amp; frameworks in client side. 
<a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is the most popular in 
this area. It has thousands of free plug-ins. There are also some tools/frameworks that makes easy to work with HTML &amp; CSS. 
For example, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">twitter bootstrap</a> is a very popular HTML/CSS 
framework.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate provides an infrastructure to automatically create a Web 
API layer from your application services and use them in javascript easily (see
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API">documentation</a>). It also provides 
a unified <a href="/Pages/Documents/Javascript-API">Javascript API</a> 
to simplify localization, showing messages and notifications and so on.</p>
<h3 id="DocOthers">Others</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate strongly uses and supports <a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">Dependency Injection</a>. It 
uses
<a href="http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx" target="_blank">
Castle Windsor</a> framework for that. It also uses
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/" target="_blank">Log4Net</a> for 
logging on server side.</p>

<h3 id="DocLayeringSummary">Summary</h3>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate uses best frameworks/libraries, also adds it's classes 
and systems to provide you a good infrastructure to build web applications 
with NLayer architecture using best practices. It has also <a href="/Templates">
templates</a> that can be used to easily create a layered solution as a starting 
point for your 
application.</p>
