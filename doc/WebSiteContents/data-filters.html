<h3 id="DocIntro">Introduction</h3>
<p>It's common to use the <a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities#DocSoftDelete">
<strong>soft-delete</strong></a> pattern which is used to not delete an entity 
from database but only mark it as 'deleted'. So, if an entity is soft-deleted, 
it should not be accidently retrieved into the application. To provide that, we 
would add a SQL <strong>where</strong> condition like 'IsDeleted = false' in 
every query we select entities. This is a tedious but more importantly a 
forgettable task. So, there should be an automatic way of it.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate provides <strong>data filters </strong>those can be used 
to automatically filter queries based on some rules. There are some pre-defined 
filters, but also you can create your own filters.</p>
<h3>Pre-defined filters</h3>
<h4>ISoftDelete</h4>
<p>Soft-delete filter is used to automatically filter (extract from results) 
deleted entities while querying database. If an
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">entity</a> should be soft-deleted, it must 
implement <strong>ISoftDelete</strong> interface which defines only IsDeleted 
property. Example:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class Person : Entity, ISoftDelete
{
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p>A <strong>Person </strong>entity is not actually deleted from database, 
instead <strong>IsDeleted </strong>property is set to true when need to delete 
it. This is done automatically by ASP.NET Boilerplate when you use <strong>
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories#DocDeleteEntity">IRepository.Delete</a></strong> 
method (you can manually set IsDeleted to true, but Delete method is more 
natural and preffered way).</p>
<p>After implementing ISoftDelete, when you get list of People from database, 
deleted people are not retrieved. Here, an example class that uses a person 
repository to get all people:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class MyService
{
    private readonly IRepository&lt;Person&gt; _personRepository;

    public MyService(IRepository&lt;Person&gt; personRepository)
    {
        _personRepository = personRepository;
    }

    public List&lt;Person&gt; GetPeople()
    {
        return _personRepository.GetAllList();
    }
}</pre>
<p>GetPeople method only gets Person entities which has IsDeleted = false (not 
deleted). All repository methods and also navigation properties properly works. 
We could add some other Where conditions, joins.. etc. It will automatically add 
IsDeleted = false condition properly.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<h4>When enabled?</h4>
	<p>ISoftDelete filter is always enabled unless you explicitly disable it.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="auto-style1">A side note</span>: If you implement
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities#DocSoftDelete">IDeletionAudited</a> (which 
extends ISoftDelete) then deletion time and deleter user id are also 
automatically set by ASP.NET Boilerplate.</p>
<h4>IMustHaveTenant</h4>
<p>If you are building multi-tenant applications (store all tenant datas in 
single database), you definitely do not want a tenant accidently see others 
data. You can implement <strong>IMustHaveTenant</strong> in that case. Example:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class Product : IMustHaveTenant
{
    public virtual int TenantId { get; set; }
        
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p><strong>IMustHaveTenant</strong> defines <strong>TenantId </strong>to 
distinguish different tenant entities. ASP.NET Boilerplate uses
<a href="/Pages/Documents/AbpSession">IAbpSession</a> to get current TenantId 
and automatically filter query for the current tenant.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<h4>When enabled?</h4>
	<p>IMustHaveTenant is enabled by default.</p>
	<p>If current user is not logged in to the system or current user is a <strong>host</strong> user (Host user is an upper level user that can 
	manage tenants and tenant datas), ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically <strong>
	disables</strong> IMustHaveTenant filter. Thus, all data of all tenant's can be 
	retrieved to the application. Notice that this is not about security, you should 
	always <a href="/Pages/Documents/Authorization">authorize</a> sensitive data.</p>
</div>

<h4>IMayHaveTenant</h4>
<p>If an entity class shared by tenants and the host (that means an entity may 
be owned by a tenant or the host), you can use IMayHaveTenant filter. <strong>
IMayHaveTenant</strong> interface also defines <strong>TenantId</strong> but it's <strong>
nullable</strong>.</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class Product : IMayHaveTenant
{
    public virtual int? TenantId { get; set; }
        
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p>A null value means this is a host entity, a non-null value means this entity 
owned by a tenant which's Id is the TenantId. ASP.NET Boilerplate uses
<a href="/Pages/Documents/AbpSession">IAbpSession</a> to get current TenantId. 
IMayHaveTenant filter is not common as much as 
IMustHaveTenant. But you may need it for common structures used by host and tenants.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<h4>When enabled?</h4>
	<p>IMayHaveTenant is enabled by default.</p>
	<p>If current user is not logged in to the system, ASP.NET Boilerplate automatically <strong>
	disables</strong> IMayHaveTenant filter. Thus, all data of host's and all tenant's can be 
	retrieved to the application. Notice that this is not about security, you should 
	always <a href="/Pages/Documents/Authorization">authorize</a> sensitive 
	data.</p>
</div>
