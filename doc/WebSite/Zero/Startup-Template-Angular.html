         <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p>The easiest way of starting a new project using ABP and module-zero for ASP.NET Core with Angular (also known as Angular2) is to create a 
            template on <a href="/Templates">templates page</a>. Remember to check "<strong>Include 
            module zero</strong>".
         </p>
         <p>After creating and downloading your project, follow below steps to run your application.</p>
         <h3>ASP.NET Core Application</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Open your solution on Visual Studio 2017+.</li>
            <li>Select the '<strong>Web.Host</strong>' project as startup project.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/mrahhal/Migrator.EF6" target="_blank">Migrator.EF</a> tool is used for adding/applying EntityFramework migrations. In order to create your database, open command prompt and move to root folder of EntityFramework project in your solution. Then run "<strong>dotnet ef database update</strong>" command."</li>
            <li>Run the application. It will show swagger-ui if it is successfull.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In this template, <strong>multi-tenancy is enabled by default</strong>. You 
            can disable it in Core project's module class if you don't need.
         </p>
         <h4>Social Logins</h4>
         <p>Startup template supports <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Google+ </strong> logins. You can see the 
            following settings in appsettings.json of Web.Host project:
         </p>
         <pre lang="json">
 "Facebook": {
  "IsEnabled": "false",
  "AppId": "",
  "AppSecret": ""
},
"Google": {
  "IsEnabled": "false",
  "ClientId": "",
  "ClientSecret": ""
}
			</pre>
         <p>Here, you can enable which you need. Surely, you must have application 
            keys and passwords which you need to get from related social web site. You 
            can find guides from web to learn how to obtain this keys. Once you enable a 
            social login and enter true keys, you will see a button in the login page. 
            You can implement other logins as similar.
         </p>
         <h4>Token Based Authentication</h4>
         <p>If you want to consume Web APIs or application services (those are exposed via 
            <a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API">dynamic 
            web api</a>) from a mobile application, you can use token based 
            authentication mechanism just we do for Angular client. Startup template includes JwtBearer token authentication 
            infrastructure.
         </p>
         <p>Here, <strong>Postman</strong> (chrome extension) will be used to demonstrate 
            requests and responses.
         </p>
         <h5>Authentication</h5>
         <p>Just send a <strong>POST</strong> request to <strong>http://localhost:62114/jwt-token/authenticate</strong> with <strong>Context-Type="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</strong> header as shown below:</p>
         <p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Request for token" src="../images/jwt-token-authenticate.png" />
         </p>
         <p>We sent form values <strong>tenancyName</strong>, <strong>usernameOrEmailAddress
            </strong>and <strong>password</strong>. tenancyName should not be sent in order to authenticate as a 
            <strong>host </strong>user. As seen above, result property of returning JSON contains the token and expire time (which is 24 hours by default and can be configured). We can save it and use for next requests.
         </p>
         <h5>Use API</h5>
         <p>After authenticate and get the <strong>token</strong>, we can use it to call any <strong>authorized</strong> 
            action. All <strong>application services </strong>are available to be used remotely. For 
            example,  we can use the <strong>User service</strong> to get a <strong>list of users</strong>:
         </p>
         <p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Authorization via token" src="../images/jwt-token-request.png" />
         </p>
         <p>Just made a <strong>GET</strong> request to <strong>http://localhost:6234/api/services/app/user/GetUsers</strong> with <strong>
            Content-Type="application/json"</strong> and <strong>Authorization="Bearer <em>
            your-</em>
            </strong>
            <em>
            <strong>auth-token</strong>
            </em>
            <strong>"</strong>. 
            Request body was just empty <strong>{}</strong>. Surely, request and response 
            body will be different for different APIs.
         </p>
         <p>Note that we also added X-Requested-With header to indicate that this is an AJAX request. Thus, ASP.NET Core can better handle the request and return appropriate return values on success and error cases.</p>
         <p>Almost all operations available on UI are also available as API and can be consumed easily.</p>
         <h4>Migrator Console Application</h4>
         <p>Startup template includes a tool, Migrator.exe, to easily migrate your databases. 
            You can run this application to create/migrate host and tenant databases.
         </p>
         <p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Database Migrator" height="230" src="../images/database-migrator.png" width="659" />
         </p>
         <p>This application gets host connection string from it's <strong>own .config 
            file</strong>. It will be same in the web.config at the beggining. Be sure that 
            the connection string in config file is the database you want. After getting
            <strong class="auto-style2">host </strong><strong>connection sring</strong>, it 
            first creates the host database or apply migrations if it does already exists. 
            Then it gets connection strings of tenant databases and runs migrations for 
            those databases. It skips a tenant if it has not a dedicated database or it's 
            database is already migrated for another tenant (for shared databases between 
            multiple tenants).
         </p>
         <p>You can use this tool on development or on product environment to 
            migrate databases on deployment, instead of EntityFramework's own 
            Migrate.exe (which requires some configuration and can work for 
            single database in one run).
         </p>
         <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
         <p>Startup template includes test infrastructure setup and a few tests under 
            the .Test project. You can check them and write similar tests easily. 
            Actually, they are integration tests rather than unit tests since they tests 
            your code with all ASP.NET Boilerplate infrastructure (including validation, 
            authorization, unit of work...).
         </p>
         <h3>Angular Application</h3>
         <h4>Prerequirements</h4>
		 <p>
			 Angular application needs to following tools be installed:
		 </p>
		 <ul>
			<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> 6.9+ with npm 3.10+</li>
			<li>Typescript 2.0+</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Restore Packages</h4>
		<p>Open a command prompt, navigate to <strong>angular</strong> folder which contains *.sln file and run the following command to restore packages:</p>
		<pre class="js">npm install</pre>
		<p>Notice that npm install may show some warn messages, which is not related to our solution and generally it's not a problem. 
    You can also use yarn to install packages. In order to do that first you need to install <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a>, then run the following command instead of npm install:</p>
    <pre class="js">yarn install</pre>
		<h4>Run The Application</h4>
		<p>In your opened command prompt, run the following command:</p>
		<pre class="js">npm start</pre>
		<p>Once the application compiled, you can browse <a href="http://localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a> in your browser. 
		Be sure that Web.Host application is running at the same time. Angular client app has also <strong>HMR</strong> (Hot Module Replacement) enabled. You can use the 
		following command (instead of npm start) to enable HMR on development time:</p>
		<h4>Login</h4>
		<p>Now you can login the application using default credentials. User name is '<strong>admin</strong>' and password is '<strong>123qwe</strong>' as default.</p>
