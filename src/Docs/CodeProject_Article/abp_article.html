<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction to the problem</h2>

<p>
    <strong>DRY </strong>- Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself! is one of the main ideas of a good developer while developing software. We&#39;re trying to implement it from simple methods to classes and modules. What about developing a new web based application? We, software developers, have similar needs when developing enterprise web applications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Enterprise web applications</strong> need login pages, user/role management infrastructure, user/application setting management, localization and so on. Also, a high quality and large scale software implement <strong>best practices</strong> such as Layered Architecture, Domain Driven Design (DDD), dependency injection (DI). Also, we use <strong>tools</strong> for Object-Releational Mapping (ORM), database migrations, logging... etc. When it comes to the <strong>user interface</strong> (UI), it&#39;s not much different.
</p>
<p>
    Starting a new enterprise web application is a hard work. Since all applications need some common tasks, we&#39;re repeating ourselves. Many companies are developing their own <strong>frameworks/libraries</strong> for such common tasks to do not re-develop same things. Others are <strong>copying</strong> some parts of existing applications and preparing <strong>a start point</strong> for their new application. First approach is pretty good if your company is big enough and has time to develop such a framework.
</p>
<p>
    As a software architect, I also developed such a framework im my company. But, there is some point it feels me bad: Many company repeats same tasks. What if we can <strong>share more, repeat less</strong>? What if DRY principle is implemented <strong>universally</strong> instead of per company? It sounds utopian, but I think there may be a starting point for that!
