ASP.NET Boilerplate
===================

What is ABP?
------------

ASP.NET Boilerplate is a starting point for new modern web applications using best practices and most popular tools. It's aimed to be a __SOLID__ model, a general-purpose __application framework__ and a project __template__.

### Framework

ASP.NET Boilerplate is an application framework built on latest __ASP.NET MVC__ & __Web API__ technologies. It makes easy to use dependency injection, logging, validation, exception handling, localization and so on. It makes these not only itself but also using most popular framework and libraries.

### Architecture

ASP.NET Boilerplate implements __NLayer architecture__ (Domain, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation Layers) and __Domain Driven Design__ (Entities, Repositories, Domain/Application Services, DTO's...). Also implements and provides a good infrastructure to implement __best practices__ such as __Dependency Injection__.

### Template

ASP.NET Boilerplate easily creates startup template for your project. It includes most used framework and libraries by default. Also allows you to choice __Single-Page__ (SPA: Angularjs or Durandaljs) or __Multi-Page__ (MVC) architecture, EntityFramework or NHibernate as ORM.
